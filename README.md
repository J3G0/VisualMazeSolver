## Assignment for Graphical applications in Java

This This project is part of the Software design C/C++ and QT class.
It is lectured by [Kris Aerts](https://github.com/krisaerts). The goal of this project

## VisualMazeSolver

This application allows the user to select a start node and an end node. Futhermore, it is possible to select a solid node, creating a Maze.
When pressing iterate it is possible to see the selected algorithm work its way to the endpoint (keep clicking). For a fast way of seeing the result, just press finish.
