## VisualMazeSolver

This application allows the user to select a startpoint and an endpoint. Futhermore, it is possible to select solid blocks, creating a Maze.
When pressing iterate it is possible to see the selected algorithm work its way to the endpoint (keep clicking). For a fast way of seeing the result, just press finish.
